# Introduction :

Today we will talk about the project of the seniors that the teacher gave us to develop further. We have seen that some functions that seniors do. There are some bugs, such as no password reset button. meaningless quran invisible font color Some verses are not read. So we want to continue to make it better. So we have extracted from the existing database and put it in and have fixed the font color and background to be more clear.
As for the features that we have added it's reset password funtion and azkar for user can read in our website.


# Problem Definition :

    Problems or bugs with this website are Can't change password When the user wants to change the password Maybe in case someone knows the user's password. make the user want to change It can't be changed. For this reason, we added a password change function and also added a Thai language meaning and azkar because azkar also it important to read every morning and evening it a sunnah too.

# Objective :

    The purpose we put the password reset function is because when the user changes the password. can change immediately will make app users more convenient And besides, we have added Thai meaning for users to know the meaning of that verse as well and also we add azkar too.

| php       | 7.4.19    |

# Requirement :

    Our requirement is for password reset function. for user convenience In case the user wants to change the password Maybe you don't want anyone to know your old password. Or the old password might be difficult to remember for whatever reason. Users can reset or change their password instantly. and also if the user wants to know the meaning Users can immediately access the meaning in the website and user can also press azkar button and read it.


# Constraints :

    The limitation of the password reset function that we have done is Let users access our website quran if you forget your password or want to change your password, you can press reset and change your password right away. After that, the system will change the password for the user. After the system completes.


# Software Method :

- Use Case Diagram 
- Data Flow Diagram
- Activity diagram
- Class Diagram


## Use Case Diagram :
    A use case diagram is a visual representation of how users interact with the various systems that make up a larger system. The main goal of designing a use case diagram is to fully describe the system's functionality and to solicit user requests. This is regarded as where system analysis and design should begin.

## Data Flow Diagram :
    A data flow diagram demonstrates the path that information takes through a system or process. It contains the numerous subprocesses the data flows through, data inputs and outputs, and data stores.

## Activity diagram :
    Activity diagrams are a method for describing work flow, business processes, and procedural logic. They serve a similar purpose to flowcharts in many aspects, but the main distinction between the two is that they permit parallel behavior.

## Class Diagram :
    Class diagrams are the blueprints of your system or subsystem. We can use class diagrams to model the objects that make up the system, to display the relationships between the objects, and to describe what those objects do and the services that they provide.
